/*
for is Goâ€™s only looping construct. Here are three basic types of for loops.
1. The most basic type, with a single condition.
2. A classic initial/condition/after for loop.
3. for without a condition will loop repeatedly until you break out of the loop or return from the enclosing function.
You can also continue to the next iteration of the loop.
